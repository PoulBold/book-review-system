&lt;p&gt;After more than ten years of publishing and selling books on Amazon, I’ve noticed a pattern that stays the same no matter how much the platform changes. As authors, we look at our listings through the lens of everything we’ve poured into them.

To us, these elements represent months — sometimes years — of effort, creativity, and personal investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
