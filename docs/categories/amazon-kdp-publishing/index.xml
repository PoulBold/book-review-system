      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-brutally-honest-2025-guide&#34;&gt;The Brutally Honest 2025 Guide&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Few niches have exploded on Amazon KDP as rapidly as low-content books: notebooks, planners, journals, trackers, guest books, log books, affirmation books, handwriting practice sheets, gratitude journals, habit trackers, and dozens of other formats. For years, thousands of beginners have been drawn to them because they appear “easy”: no writing, no editing, no research—just upload and earn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But reality is different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that &lt;strong&gt;low-content books are now one of the most challenging, oversaturated, low-margin, and marketing-intensive categories on Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;. The barrier to entry is low, meaning competition is extreme. At the same time, buyers rarely leave reviews, advertising costs are high, and organic visibility is almost impossible without strong branding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
